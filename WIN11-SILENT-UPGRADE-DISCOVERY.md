# Windows 11 Silent Upgrade Discovery

## Key Finding
The Windows 11 Installation Assistant can run COMPLETELY SILENTLY without any user interaction when executed properly.

## Working Method
```powershell
# Download Installation Assistant
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2171764" -OutFile "C:\Win11.exe"

# Create scheduled task as SYSTEM
schtasks /create /f /tn "Win11Upgrade" /tr "C:\Win11.exe /QuietInstall /SkipEULA" /sc once /st 00:00 /ru SYSTEM

# Run the task
schtasks /run /tn "Win11Upgrade"
```

## Why This Works
1. **SYSTEM Account**: Running as SYSTEM bypasses EULA prompts
2. **QuietInstall**: Suppresses all UI elements
3. **SkipEULA**: Attempts to bypass license agreement
4. **Scheduled Task**: Provides proper elevation and context

## Advantages Over ISO Method
- ✅ No ISO download needed (3GB+ saved)
- ✅ No mounting/unmounting complexity
- ✅ No DISM or setup.exe parameters
- ✅ Much simpler deployment
- ✅ Smaller download (4MB vs 3GB+)
- ✅ Microsoft's official upgrade path
- ✅ Automatic driver and app compatibility checks

## What Happens
1. Installation Assistant downloads Windows 11 files in background
2. Prepares the upgrade silently
3. Automatically restarts when ready
4. Completes upgrade through multiple restarts
5. No user interaction required at any point

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Direct PowerShell
```powershell
irm https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2171764 -OutFile C:\Win11.exe; schtasks /create /f /tn Win11Up /tr 'C:\Win11.exe /QuietInstall /SkipEULA' /sc once /st 00:00 /ru SYSTEM; schtasks /run /tn Win11Up
```

### Option 2: PSADT Wrapper
Use PSADT for better logging, pre-checks, and control, but core upgrade is just:
```powershell
Execute-Process -Path "$envTemp\Windows11InstallationAssistant.exe" -Parameters "/QuietInstall /SkipEULA" -RunAsScheduledTask
```

## Important Notes
- Must run as SYSTEM (not regular admin)
- Process runs completely hidden
- No progress UI visible
- Monitor via Task Manager or scheduled task status
- Automatic restart will occur

This is MUCH simpler than the ISO-based approach and should be the preferred method for silent deployments!
