# ‚ö° QUICK FIX CODE SNIPPETS

## üéØ FASTEST FIX (Add Exit After Each Scheduling)

### Find These Lines and Add Exit-Script:

**1. Line ~299** (After successful scheduling from calendar):
```powershell
Write-Log -Message "Successfully scheduled upgrade" -Source $deployAppScriptFriendlyName
# Set flag to skip upgrade and exit gracefully
$script:SchedulingComplete = $true
# Disable balloon notifications since we're not installing
$configShowBalloonNotifications = $false
Exit-Script -ExitCode 3010  # ‚Üê ADD THIS LINE
```

**2. Line ~334** (After custom date/time scheduling):
```powershell
Write-Log -Message "Successfully scheduled upgrade for $scheduleDate" -Source $deployAppScriptFriendlyName
# Set flag to skip upgrade and exit gracefully
$script:SchedulingComplete = $true
$configShowBalloonNotifications = $false
Exit-Script -ExitCode 3010  # ‚Üê ADD THIS LINE
```

**3. Line ~201** (After keeping existing schedule):
```powershell
Write-Log -Message "User kept existing schedule" -Source $deployAppScriptFriendlyName
# Set flag to skip upgrade and exit gracefully
$script:SchedulingComplete = $true
$configShowBalloonNotifications = $false
Exit-Script -ExitCode 3010  # ‚Üê ADD THIS LINE
```

**4. Line ~213** (After cancelling schedule):
```powershell
Write-Log -Message "User cancelled schedule" -Source $deployAppScriptFriendlyName
Remove-UpgradeSchedule -Force
# Set flag to skip upgrade and exit gracefully
$script:SchedulingComplete = $true
$configShowBalloonNotifications = $false
Exit-Script -ExitCode 3010  # ‚Üê ADD THIS LINE
```

**5. Line ~424** (In fallback scheduling section):
```powershell
Write-Log -Message "Successfully scheduled upgrade for $($schedule.NextRunTime)" -Source $deployAppScriptFriendlyName
# Set flag to skip upgrade and exit gracefully
$script:SchedulingComplete = $true
$configShowBalloonNotifications = $false
Exit-Script -ExitCode 3010  # ‚Üê ADD THIS LINE
```

**6. Line ~459** (Another fallback scheduling location):
```powershell
Write-Log -Message "Successfully scheduled upgrade for $scheduleDate" -Source $deployAppScriptFriendlyName
# Set flag to skip upgrade and exit gracefully
$script:SchedulingComplete = $true
$configShowBalloonNotifications = $false
Exit-Script -ExitCode 3010  # ‚Üê ADD THIS LINE
```

## üîç HOW TO FIND THESE LOCATIONS

Run this PowerShell command to find all locations:
```powershell
Select-String '$script:SchedulingComplete = $true' "C:\Code\Windows\Win11UpgradeScheduler-FINAL\src\Deploy-Application-InstallationAssistant-Version.ps1" | ForEach-Object { "Line $($_.LineNumber): $($_.Line.Trim())" }
```

## üß™ TEST COMMAND

After adding the Exit-Script lines:
```powershell
& "C:\Code\Windows\Win11UpgradeScheduler-FINAL\src\Deploy-Application-InstallationAssistant-Version.ps1"
```

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS

You'll know it's fixed when:
1. No "ERROR: Installation region reached" in the log
2. Script exits immediately after scheduling confirmation
3. Exit code is 3010 (not 0)

## üí° ALTERNATIVE: SINGLE CHECKPOINT FIX

If you prefer ONE fix location, add this right before line 478:
```powershell
# Check if scheduling was completed before proceeding
If ($script:SchedulingComplete) {
    Write-Log -Message "Scheduling was completed - exiting without installation" -Source $deployAppScriptFriendlyName
    Exit-Script -ExitCode 3010
}

# Check if scheduling was completed - if so, skip the upgrade
If (-not $script:SchedulingComplete) {
    # ... existing code ...
```

## üìù REMEMBER

- Use `Exit-Script` not `exit` or `return`
- Exit code 3010 means "soft reboot required" (commonly used for deferred installs)
- Test after EACH change to verify it works
