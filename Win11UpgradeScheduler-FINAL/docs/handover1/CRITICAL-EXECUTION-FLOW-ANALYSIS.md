# CRITICAL EXECUTION FLOW ANALYSIS

## Key Discovery
The conditional check `If (-not $script:SchedulingComplete)` at line 468 is NOT producing its expected log output!

## Evidence from Logs

### What we see in the logs:
```
[07-18-2025 06:03:08.793] [Execution] :: Successfully scheduled upgrade
[07-18-2025 06:03:09.005] [Execution] :: Starting Windows 11 upgrade process
```

### What we DON'T see in the logs:
- Line 469: "No scheduling occurred or user chose immediate upgrade, proceeding with installation"
- Line 869: "User successfully scheduled upgrade, skipping immediate installation"

## This means one of two things:

### Possibility 1: The condition check is being bypassed entirely
The code flow might be jumping directly to the Installation region without evaluating the If statement.

### Possibility 2: The Installation region is being called from somewhere else
There might be another code path that's triggering the installation.

## Specific Investigation Needed

1. **Check if line 618 is the ONLY place that logs "Starting Windows 11 upgrade process"**
   ```powershell
   grep -n "Starting Windows 11 upgrade process" Deploy-Application-InstallationAssistant-Version.ps1
   ```

2. **Verify the actual structure around line 468**
   - Is there a syntax error preventing the If from executing?
   - Is the condition malformed?

3. **Check for any goto/jump logic**
   - Are there any labels or jumps that might bypass the conditional?

4. **Examine PSADT's automatic behavior**
   - Is PSADT triggering installation automatically based on deployment type?

## Critical Code Section to Examine (Lines 465-470)
```powershell
            }
            }
            
            # Check if scheduling was completed - if so, skip the upgrade
            If (-not $script:SchedulingComplete) {
                Write-Log -Message "No scheduling occurred or user chose immediate upgrade, proceeding with installation" -Source $deployAppScriptFriendlyName
```

Note the double closing braces at lines 464-465. This might indicate a structural issue.

## The Smoking Gun
Neither the If block's log message nor the Else block's log message appears in the execution log. This strongly suggests the entire conditional structure is being bypassed or is malformed.
