# Executive Summary: Script Flow Bug

## The Problem
User schedules Windows 11 upgrade for later → Script immediately runs the upgrade anyway

## The Evidence
```
[06:03:08.793] Successfully scheduled upgrade
[06:03:09.005] Starting Windows 11 upgrade process ← Should NOT happen!
```

## The Implementation
- Flag variable: `$script:SchedulingComplete`
- Set to `$true` after scheduling (line 294)
- Checked before upgrade: `If (-not $script:SchedulingComplete)` (line 468)

## The Mystery
**The conditional check is NOT executing!**
- No log output from inside the If block (line 469)
- No log output from the Else block (line 869)
- Script jumps directly to Installation region

## Where to Look
1. **Lines 464-468**: Multiple closing braces followed by the If statement
2. **Line 617**: Installation region start
3. **Line 866**: Where the If block supposedly ends

## Tools Provided
1. **AI-ENGINEER-SCRIPT-FLOW-FIX.md** - Detailed analysis
2. **Test-SchedulingExitBehavior.ps1** - Structure verification
3. **Debug-ConditionalFlow.ps1** - Runtime debugging
4. **Quick-Structure-Check.ps1** - Line number finder

## Quick Test
```powershell
# Run the script
# Choose "Schedule" 
# Pick "Tomorrow - Afternoon"
# Watch for "Starting Windows 11 upgrade process" in logs
# If it appears = BUG CONFIRMED
```

## Solution Needed
Fix the code structure so the Installation region only runs when `$script:SchedulingComplete` is `$false`
