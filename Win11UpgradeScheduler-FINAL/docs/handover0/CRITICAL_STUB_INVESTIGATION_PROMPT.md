# CRITICAL INVESTIGATION: Production Code Stub Files

## URGENT PRIORITY - PRODUCTION CODE INTEGRITY ISSUE

### Executive Summary
During project organization, we discovered that critical production files have been replaced with minimal stub implementations. This is a **SEVERE** issue affecting system functionality. The production deployment contains non-functional stub files instead of complete implementations.

### Background Context
- **Project**: Windows 11 Upgrade Scheduler with PSADT v3.10.2
- **Location**: `C:\code\Windows\Win11UpgradeScheduler-FINAL\`
- **Issue Discovery**: Scheduled tasks were completing in seconds without performing any actions
- **Root Cause**: Critical files contain only stub implementations (5-20 lines) instead of full code (300-500 lines)

### Known Affected Files (Confirmed)
1. **ScheduledTaskWrapper.ps1**
   - Stub: 12 lines (only session detection, immediate exit)
   - Production: 348 lines (full countdown, pre-flight checks, deployment launch)
   - Fixed by replacing with version from `Win11Detection\archive\drafts\`

2. **Modules (Previously Fixed)**
   - `01-UpgradeScheduler.psm1`: Was 18 lines, should be 494 lines
   - `02-PreFlightChecks.psm1`: Was 22 lines, should be 535 lines
   - Fixed by replacing with versions from `Win11Detection\archive\drafts\`

### Your Mission
Conduct a comprehensive investigation to identify ALL stub files in the production codebase and replace them with their complete implementations.

### Investigation Scope

#### 1. Primary Search Locations
```
C:\code\Windows\Win11UpgradeScheduler-FINAL\src\
├── Deploy-Application.ps1           # Check if complete
├── AppDeployToolkit\               # Verify all PSADT files
├── SupportFiles\
│   ├── Modules\                    # Already fixed, but verify
│   ├── UI\                         # Check all UI scripts
│   └── ScheduledTaskWrapper.ps1    # Already fixed, but verify
└── Files\                          # Check for any scripts here
```

#### 2. Archive Locations with Full Implementations
```
C:\code\Windows\Win11Detection\archive\drafts\Win11UpgradeScheduler\
C:\code\Windows\Win11UpgradeScheduler-FINAL\archive\iterations\v1-initial\
C:\code\Windows\Win11UpgradeScheduler-FINAL\archive\iterations\v2-enhanced\
C:\code\Windows\Win11UpgradeScheduler-FINAL\archive\original-development\
```

### Detection Methodology

#### Step 1: Identify Potential Stubs
Look for files with these characteristics:
- Unusually small file size (< 1KB for .ps1 files, < 2KB for .psm1 files)
- Line count < 50 for scripts that should have complex logic
- Contains only basic function definitions without implementation
- Has comments like "Main logic", "TODO", or minimal functionality
- Missing expected functions based on file name

#### Step 2: Compare Against Archives
For each suspected stub:
1. Search for the same filename in all archive locations
2. Compare file sizes and line counts
3. Check for matching function names but different implementations
4. Look for version comments indicating "simplified", "test", or "stub"

#### Step 3: Verification Patterns
Stub files typically contain:
```powershell
# Example stub pattern
function Do-Something {
    Write-Output "Function called"
    return $true
}
# Main logic
exit 0
```

Production files contain:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging
- Multiple functions with full implementations
- Parameter validation
- Complex business logic

### Critical Files to Investigate

1. **UI Components** (`src\SupportFiles\UI\`)
   - `01-Show-EnhancedCalendarPicker.ps1`
   - `02-Show-UpgradeInformationDialog.ps1`
   - `03-Show-CalendarPicker-Original.ps1`

2. **Core Scripts**
   - `Deploy-Application.ps1` (should be 300+ lines)
   - Any .ps1 files in SupportFiles\

3. **PSADT Framework** (`src\AppDeployToolkit\`)
   - Verify all files match standard PSADT v3.10.2 distribution
   - Check against the .zip file in `tools\deployment\PSAppDeployToolkit_v3.10.2.zip`

### Action Plan for Each Stub Found

1. **Document the Finding**
   ```
   File: [Path to stub file]
   Current: [Size] / [Line count]
   Expected: [Size] / [Line count] (based on archive version)
   Archive Location: [Where full version was found]
   Key Missing Features: [List what's missing]
   ```

2. **Replace Process**
   - Backup current stub to `archive\stubs-backup\` with timestamp
   - Copy full version from archive
   - Update any paths if needed (e.g., module references)
   - Test the replaced file

3. **Validation**
   - Ensure replaced file has expected functionality
   - Check for any hardcoded paths that need updating
   - Verify module imports work correctly

### Reference: Project Structure Map
See: `C:\code\Windows\Win11UpgradeScheduler-FINAL\ORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md` for the complete project structure.

### Reporting Requirements

Create a report: `STUB_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md` containing:
1. Total files checked
2. Stub files found (with details)
3. Files replaced
4. Files that couldn't be resolved
5. Recommendations for preventing this in future

### CRITICAL NOTES
- This is a PRODUCTION BLOCKING issue
- Each stub file represents broken functionality
- Users are experiencing failures due to these stubs
- Complete investigation TODAY
- Test each replacement to ensure functionality

### Example Investigation Commands
```powershell
# Find small PowerShell files (potential stubs)
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\code\Windows\Win11UpgradeScheduler-FINAL\src" -Recurse -Filter "*.ps1" | 
    Where-Object { $_.Length -lt 1024 } | 
    Select-Object FullName, Length

# Compare file sizes between directories
$prodFile = Get-Item "path\to\prod\file.ps1"
$archiveFile = Get-Item "path\to\archive\file.ps1"
"Prod: $($prodFile.Length) bytes, Archive: $($archiveFile.Length) bytes"

# Count lines in files
(Get-Content "path\to\file.ps1").Count
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All stub files identified and documented
- [ ] All stubs replaced with production versions
- [ ] All replaced files tested and working
- [ ] No functionality broken by stub files
- [ ] Comprehensive report delivered
