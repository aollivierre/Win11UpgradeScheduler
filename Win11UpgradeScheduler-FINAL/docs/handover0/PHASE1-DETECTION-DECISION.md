# Decision Required: Phase1-Detection\Win11Scheduler-PSADT-v3

## Current Situation
The folder `C:\code\Windows\Phase1-Detection\Win11Scheduler-PSADT-v3` contains the development version of the Windows 11 Upgrade Scheduler that we've now organized into the FINAL structure.

## What We've Already Done
- ✅ Copied all PSADT framework files to FINAL\src\AppDeployToolkit\
- ✅ Copied all modules to FINAL\src\SupportFiles\Modules\ (now with production versions)
- ✅ Copied all UI components to FINAL\src\SupportFiles\UI\
- ✅ Copied all test files to FINAL\tests\
- ✅ Copied deployment script as FINAL\src\Deploy-Application.ps1
- ✅ Archived documentation and tools

## Options for Phase1-Detection\Win11Scheduler-PSADT-v3:

### Option 1: Keep As Reference (Recommended)
- Leave it untouched as the original development source
- Useful for comparison and reference
- Maintains project history

### Option 2: Archive and Remove
- Move entire folder to FINAL\archive\original-development\
- Clean up the Phase1-Detection directory
- Reduces duplication

### Option 3: Remove Completely
- Delete the folder since everything is organized in FINAL
- Most aggressive cleanup approach
- Risk of losing reference material

## Recommendation
**Option 1** - Keep it as reference since you specified not to touch Phase1-Detection. The FINAL structure is now self-contained and production-ready, while Phase1-Detection serves as the development history.
