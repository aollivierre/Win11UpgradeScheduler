All contents have been organized and improved in the main FINAL structure:
- Production modules were taken from Win11Detection\archive\drafts\ (not from here - these had stub versions)
- PSADT framework files -> src\AppDeployToolkit\
- UI components -> src\SupportFiles\UI\
- Tests -> tests\
- Documentation -> docs\

This archive is kept for historical reference and development history.
